The challenges appearing on the bookcases is a beautiful touch, can't wait to fill the shelves in the final version.","There's two things:
* Some non-showdowns had targets impractical to use without emetics, like the people betting on the auction in Paris.
* Dying removed all tools in the safehouse briefcases, which makes no sense.","Spelling errors in a lot of places, like ""desguises"" on the alerted territory info.
